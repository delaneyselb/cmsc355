Contains sprints for CMSC355 project. Our project is a simple Veterinary Hospital Database with pet info and search/sort by options for animal records.

Sprint 1:
We focused on implementing the sort by pet name (alphabetically) and search by pet name use cases. We struggled with the initial organization of the code and classes. Once we figured out an optimal setup, we were stuck on getting user input, which we handled with scan.nextLine() manipulation, break statements, and a continuing condition for a while loop. Then, we were held up by uppercase not being shown in records for searchByName(). We worked around this.
